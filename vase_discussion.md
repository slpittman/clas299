# Discussion on the Distribution of Pioneer Group Painted Pottery #

## Group 4: Stephen Pittman and Ryan Wynn ##

The distribution of Greek painted pottery from the sets of data we gathered from Beazley's work seem to show an overall development of a westward shift of find spots from the time of the Pioneer Group and after. However what specific pieces of pottery we managed to lay onto the maps are not necessarily representative, as a vast amount of pieces listed in Beazley bore found spots whose coordinates could not be found. This is true at least for our group's assigned painters, i.e. Euthymides and Manner of Euthymides, and it is presumed that for the rest of the groups whose work formed the composite also experienced similar problems.

In general, the find spots of pottery attributed to the earlier black figure painters/potters, Sophilos and Kleitias, are more focused about the Aegean, including Asia Minor, with two find spots outside the region in western Italy and Egypt. A find spot in Egypt remains from the era of the black figure painters until the later Classical ones, the Achilles Painter and the Tyszkiewicz Painter, as well as find spots around the region of manufacture, in Attica and central Greece. The westward motion of pottery find spots begins with the Pioneer Group and appears in the loss of find spots in the eastern Aegean along the Anatolian coast whilst simultaneously there is an enormous increase in find spots and number of pieces found in Italy.

Euthymides' pieces and pieces labeled by Beazley as in the Manner of Euthymides follow the pioneer group in general in its find spot pattern, but with an exclusive focus on Italy, other than the universal finding of pieces in the approximate region of manufacture. Euthymides' pieces in Italy seem to be in two areas primarily: the Western coast and Sicily, with an enormous number found in a northern site in Etruria. Perhaps he focused on an Italian market?
